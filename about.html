  <div class="page-media" id='about-details'>
      <p>I hold a B.S. in Computer Engineering with High Honors from San Francisco State University. My major area of emphasis was is computer science, particularly software engineering and internet application design and development.  I'd like to take this opportunity to thank my classmates, instructors, and professors for their support and encouragment during those years where the balding area atop my head increased proportionally to the engineering knowledge I obtained. Solving perplexing problems using computers is my passion and brings me a warm tingling sensation.</p>
      <p>My primary weapons on the computing battlefield are the terminal, Sublime Text (one day I will purchase a license!), GitHub, and google search. With respect to web application development, I'm fond of the power and elegance of Ruby on Rails. Rails is my go-to framework when MVC architecture is applicable. MVC architecture shall not be esteemed lightly. I find Bootstrap and Materialize powerful utilities on the front-end. I have to give a shout out to the jQuery and Heroku teams! Thanks for making life more pleasant.

      <p>My current endeavors involve taking abstract ideas and turning them into a reality in the form of software.  Also, I'm continously honing my skills in the web domain, building SPA's using JS end-to-end and digging further into the internals of Rails amongst a plethora of other topics that are attached to the science, yes science, of web development.</p>

      <p>When the time presents itself for me to brush up on other CmpE/CS topics, I find myself involved with Java programming, software techniques for computer music, DSP, data networking and communications, embedded systems, and electric circuits. </p>

      <p>Surprisingly enough, there is a world outside of computing.  In this alternate reality, I enjoy athletics, skateboarding, snowboarding, martial arts, backpacking, and tea drinking. Thank you.</p>
